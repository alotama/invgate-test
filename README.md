# "CSS Test"
This is a technical test for ** InvGate **. In this test, the developer is expected to achieve a receptive design that includes a top bar, a Sideba and the main content with a sub-grid with two columns. Within the main column there is a grid of content that is responsive.

The only limitation was that it is not recommended to use a framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation. That's why we decided to use CSS Grid.

## Technologies
 - HTML5 / CSS3
 - BEM
 - SASS
